= Camel K Workshop

== Workshop Requirements


=== Ansible Automation

* https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible 3]
- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-node-requirements[Ansible's requirement]
* https://pypi.org/project/kubernetes/[Python's Kubernetes module]

=== Resource Consumption per User

[NOTE]
====
TBD
====

Take the above resource consumption as a base to calculate the amount of resource you will need for your workshop.

=== OpenShift 4.9

This workshops requires a OpenShift environment with users already defined. They must be named as `user`+ `number`, like `user1`, and have the same password, `openshift`.
Have as many as you need for your activity.


[NOTE]
====
This workshop is specifically tested with OCP 4.9. Older versions have API incompatibilities that will break the automation.
====

=== CodeReady Workspaces

You just need a updated browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox :)
