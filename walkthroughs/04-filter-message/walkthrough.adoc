= Lab 4 - Filtering Message Content

As developers/architecs we will usually find scenarios where we need to filter the content coming from a data source. Camel has the power to work with many data formats, but for this lab we're going to tackle one of the most common data format used in REST API's, JSON.

To interact with our JSON content, were are going to use a very powerful expression language, https://goessner.net[JsonPath].
